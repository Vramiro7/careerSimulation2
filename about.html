		<h2>Martial Arts</h2>
		<section class="aboutcontainer">
			<section id="aboutMe1">
					<section class="leftText">
						<p>Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practiced for a number of reasons such as self-defence; 
							military and law enforcement applications; competition; physical, mental, and spiritual development; entertainment; 
							and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage. "Martial arts" is a direct English translation of the 
							Sino-Japanese word (Japanese: 武芸, romanized: bu-gei, Chinese: 武藝; pinyin: wǔyì; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: bú-gē). Literally, it refers 
							to "武 martial" and "艺 arts". It was first used in the Japanese-English dictionary "Takenobu Japanese-English Dictionary 
							(Collection of the National Diet Library of Japan)" published by a Japanese in 1918, and then spread to the general public in the West.
							This is why the term "martial arts" is now often associated with oriental martial arts that are strongly associated with orientalism, rather than simply referring to combat systems. </p>

				<section class="rightText">
					<p>A video game[a] or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device (such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device)
					to generate visual feedback from a display device, most commonly shown in a video format on a television set, computer monitor, flat-panel display or touchscreen on handheld devices, or a
					irtual reality headset. Most modern video games are audiovisual, with audio complement delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes also with other types of sensory feedback 
					(e.g., haptic technology that provides tactile sensations). Some video games also allow microphone and webcam inputs for in-game chatting and livestreaming.</p>

					<section class="leftText">
						<p>Teaching is the practice implemented by a teacher aimed at transmitting skills (knowledge, know-how, and interpersonal skills)
							to a learner, a student, or any other audience in the context of an educational institution. Teaching is closely related to learning,
							the student's activity of appropriating this knowledge. Teaching is part of the broader concept of education.</p>
